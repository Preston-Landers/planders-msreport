Web Components\index{Web Components} are a powerful addition to the web developer's arsenal. 
Their fundamental premise is that web content can be componentized, encapsulted\index{encapsulation}, and abstracted\index{abstraction} behind well-defined APIs\index{API}.
Eventually this functionality will be delivered directly by the browser without needing a dedicated JavaScript\index{JavaScript} framework.
%But for the immediate future, using Web Components in your application means that your clients must download a large blob of JavaScript library code -- the polyfill\index{polyfill} --- 
%that enables Custom Elements\index{Custom Elements}, 
%shadow DOM\index{Shadow DOM}, 
%templates\index{HTML!Templates}, and 
%the component import system\index{HTML!Imports}.
But for the immediate future, using Web Components in your application means that your clients must download a large blob of JavaScript library code---the polyfill\index{polyfill}---to enable its features: 
Custom Elements\index{Custom Elements}, 
shadow DOM\index{Shadow DOM}, 
templates\index{HTML!Templates}, and 
the component import system\index{HTML!Imports}.

Web Components have set out on the right path to becoming a mature, widely deployed technology. 
Newer frameworks like Polymer\index{Polymer} provide powerful abstractions but are still undergoing rapid evolution.
Older, more established frameworks like Angular\index{Angular} have already begun the process of adapting to the new Web Component world. 
Success will be found at the end of this road as long as framework and component authors remain mindful of the guiding principles of Web Components: 
to be small, focused, extensible, adaptive, 
and most of all, 
to deliver the key benefits 
not only to the software engineers\index{software engineering} who make the web run,
but to the content \textit{authors} that have made it the indispensable communications medium of the modern age.
